2025-05-11 Require declaration of affiliation from TC Candidates
================================================================

All candidates running for the OpenStack Technical Committee (TC) must have
their organizational affiliation listed in their OpenInfra Foundation community
profile at the time of self-nomination. The affiliations must also be listed on
their nominations. Organizational Affiliation is defined in the `TC's
charter <../reference/charter.html#tc-diversity-requirement>`_.

This disclosure was informally encouraged in the past to promote transparency
and help voters make informed decisions. It was also implied in the `diversity
requirement`_ in the TC's charter.

The Election Officials are requested to check if affiliation has been declared
on a candidate's OpenInfra Foundation community profile and within their
candidacy while validating a nomination. Candidates cannot declare an
affiliation within their candidacy that is not listed within their OpenInfra
Foundation community profile. Unaffiliated candidates may use "Unaffiliated"
or a similar word to declare their lack of affiliation.

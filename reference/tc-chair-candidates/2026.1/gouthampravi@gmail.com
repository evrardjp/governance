Dear TC colleagues,

I would like to nominate myself to serve as the
OpenStack Technical Committee Chair through the 2026.1 cycle.

Over my tenure as chair, I've brought my distinctive
flair to this role while honoring the storied tradition
of building consensus respectfully and engaging with all
issues, whether they be significant architectural decisions
or smaller day-to-day concerns that matter deeply to our
community members. This balanced approach has allowed me to
maintain the collaborative spirit that defines OpenStack
governance while introducing fresh perspectives on how we
can work together more effectively.

My focus has been on streamlining our operations without
losing the thoughtful deliberation that makes our decisions
robust. I've worked to reduce bureaucratic friction while
preserving the essential elements that ensure all voices
are heard and considered. I believe that this approach to
process improvement helps create a governance structure that
is both efficient and inclusive.

Thank you for your consideration and for the privilege of
serving this community.

Best regards,
Goutham Pacha Ravi (gouthamr)
